## Notes

As I was walking through the videos, I would often stumble across import errors or errors from deprecated methods. Luckily it was solved
when I looked at a few Android Studio documentation. 
Another place I found myself stuck in was making sure the icons were aligned properly. Often some of the icons or buttons were too big or small for the implementation.

## Notes

A challenge I encountered while creating this application was when I was changing activites and adding click listeners to my buttons. It turns out that I needed to also
add these new activities into my AndroidManifest.xml! The changes worked eventually.
